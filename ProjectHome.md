FIN is an Android application designed to help you locate items and services fast.  Unlike Google Maps, we operate on small-scale regions.  This allows us to track restrooms, vending machines, mailboxes, and other items that none of the popular map and location apps are capable of.  We have built the app to be clean, fast, and extensible, with the solitary goal of helping you find things as quickly as possible.

We currently support the University of Washington, with support for more regions coming soon!

We've developed a simple and elegant way to expand FIN to virtually any campus in the world, so If you are interested in bringing FIN to your campus or region, contact us at help@project-fin.org
